# Chapter 18: Texture Sampling and Tiling Backgrounds

This chapter explores texture sampling states in MonoGame and how they affect the appearance of rendered textures. You will learn how to create tiling backgrounds and special effects using different sampling modes.

The chapter covers:

- Understanding texture sampling and normalized coordinates.
- Exploring different filtering modes (Point, Linear, Anisotropic).
- Working with addressing modes (Wrap, Mirror, Clamp, Border).
- Implementing scrolling backgrounds using SamplerState.PointWrap.
- Adding visual depth to your game's screens.
