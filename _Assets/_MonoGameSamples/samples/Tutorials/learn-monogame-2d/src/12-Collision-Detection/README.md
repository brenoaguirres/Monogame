# Chapter 12: Collision Detection

This chapter introduces collision detection techniques for your game. You will learn how to detect when game objects interact with each other and implement appropriate responses like blocking, triggering events, or bouncing.

The chapter covers:

- Understanding different collision shapes and detection methods.
- Implementing circle-based collision detection.
- Creating a Circle struct for collision calculations.
- Handling collision responses (blocking, triggering, bouncing).
- Applying collision detection in your game.
