The chapter covers:

- Creating an AudioController class to manage game audio.
- Implementing the IDisposable pattern for proper resource cleanup.
- Adding global volume control for music and sound effects.
- Implementing audio state management (play/pause, mute/unmute).
- Integrating the audio controller with the game's core systems.
