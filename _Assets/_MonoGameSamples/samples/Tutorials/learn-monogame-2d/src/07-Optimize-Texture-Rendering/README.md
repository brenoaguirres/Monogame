# Chapter 07: Optimizing Texture Rendering

This chapter introduces texture atlases as a solution for optimizing texture rendering. You will learn how to reduce texture swapping by combining multiple images into a single texture, improving your game's performance.

The chapter covers:

- Understanding texture swapping and its performance impact.
- Creating a TextureRegion class for managing regions within a texture.
- Implementing a TextureAtlas class for organizing multiple sprites.
- Loading texture regions from XML configuration files.
- Using the atlas in your game.
